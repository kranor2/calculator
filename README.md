# calculator

## Description

This is my final project within the Foundations Course with The Odin Project. As my third larger project in JavaScript, this project is my response to the prompt wherein students are challenged to use learned and new concepts in JavaScript to create a functional (if basic) calculator within a webpage.

With help from a previous TDD exercise in the course (which served as part of the basis for my operate() function), this project got me much better acquainted with DOM Manipulation and UI concepts that I had previously learned and implemented in (Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock)[https://github.com/kranor2/rock-paper-scissors], such as event listeners, query selectors, and function expressions. I was also able to further my problem-solving and independent research skills by exploring new CSS skills, including using hover/active button states to create button animations, and using JS to enable keyboard compatibility. I've also built upon my experience in debugging, especially using the browser console. In this debugging experience, I gained more understanding of the relationship between the HTML and JS files while trying to manipulate the DOM.

This project has served to grow my interest in JavaScript, which I plan to continue learning and exploring with help from The Odin Project's JavaScript course.
